# GoshawkDB Homebrew Tap

This repo is a [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) Tap for GoshawkDB. So if
you're using Homebrew, you should be able to install GoshawkDB by
using:

    brew install goshawkdb/goshawkdb/goshawkdb-server

After that, you probably want to read
the [Getting Started](https://goshawkdb.io/starting.html) guide.
